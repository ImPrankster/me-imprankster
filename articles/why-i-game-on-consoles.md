The war between console gamers and PC gamers has never ended. I used to be a total PC guy, believing the freedom PC means for gaming. But recently, I started to understand why people want to game on consoles.

## Exclusivity

Exclusivity is one thing we can not ignore when talking about console gaming. Sure, exclusive titles are one major selling point for consoles. Some people argue that console giants profit by limiting people's access to games. But this is only half the truth. Exclusive titles were made because of the competition between console giants. Most of the good AAA franchises like Mario, Zelda, Uncharted, God of war, The Last Of Us, all come from studios owned by console giants. Selling consoles is more profitable than selling games, this is why big budget games need to be in some way “bundled” with consoles.

## User Experiences

But exclusive titles is not the only reason I use consoles. Especially when more and more exclusive titles are being released on PC. And more and more great indie games are coming out, which by its nature are multi-platform. But one thing the PC has struggled with is User Experience. Without limitation, many features we took for granted on consoles are missing on the PC. Like pausing a game at any time, being able to adjust system settings while not interrupting the game (yes you could sometimes force it to quit to desktop while leaving the game running in the background on the PC, but it just does not always work, and also can lead to many unexpected behaviors). Or you just want to start a game without going through the launcher, which sometimes puts the start time on the PC in a bad place even when SSDs are installed. Surely not every game developer will put you through a bad experience. But as there is no policy controlling this, there will only be more.

## Separation of Work & Play

This is critical for your life quality. I can not keep track of how many times my studio driver, which is required for my work, will cause a game to not run, or games will cause weird behaviors that make the computer unusable.
Sure, you can build two computers. But why bother? It costs way more, just get a console.
