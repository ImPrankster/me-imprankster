## Hi, this is Ruofan.

I'm currently a sutdent living in Shanghai, This Blog is mainly for documenting my life and showcasing some of the project I've been working on.

I'm interested in Tech, Gaming, Interactive & Media Design, and Front End & Game Devlopment.

The articles will mainly be related to these topics, or just some random thoughts I had.

You can also find me on [Github](https://github.com/ImPrankster) and many other platforms, Use Telegram to contact [me](https://t.me/ImPrankster).

If you want to use this website as a template, there is a Blog website template repo under my github account, feel free to use it.

Have a nice day!
