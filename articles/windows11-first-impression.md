Windows 11 beta is currently on both Dev Channel and Beta Channel, both requiring users to enroll in Windows Insider Programme, however, the new windows is still buggy and unstable, and it's not meant for the average user to drive daily. Make sure to have backups before installing Windows 11 beta.

## New design language

The new look is definitely the biggest change made on Windows 11, and probably will be most people's reason to upgrade to win11. As a guy who also uses MacOS and Manjaro Linux, I'd say the overall look is quite nice. The design language and Interface is very similar to GNOME, it also supports global color themes and a whole new set of icons. The rounded corner may seem unbearable to some diehard windows fans, but the truth is it won't affect your productivity and just looks way more modern.

We also saw a change in system fonts, new Segoe UI font now has a better look in latin letters, it also improved CJK charset rendering, maybe we no long need to patch the CJK charset rendering issue like we used to do on Windows 10 in the future.

## Interface & Layout

If you have used Mac OS and Manjaro Linux, you may find the new interface in Windows 11 very familiar, The task bar is now centered by default, start menu is replaced with a menu with pinned apps and will show recent files. Although I think the old Tile design is a cool concept, few apps support it, so abandoning the whole idea seems to be reasonable.

The settings program also changed a lot, it now has less reference link to Control Panel, providing a more unified experience. The layout of each item is also more intuitive and easier to use.

## Gaming Performance

Windows 11 has a new feature that will improve Game loading times, as a response to Sony's new data transmitting technology on PS5. However, I do not think improving loading time will have a big impact on gaming experience, It's still nice to have for some hardcore gamers.

## Android App Support?

Microsoft have announced that they will support Android Apps natively in Windows 11, it might completely change the Microsoft Store, which compared to App Store on Mac, is just unusable. But this feature has not shown up on Windows 11 yet.

## Downsides

Just like in Windows 10, a lot of Apps in Windows 11 still don't support the newest styling, we can still see stuff that can be dated back to Windows 7 or even Windows XP & 95 ( such as the sound settings in Control Panel ).
