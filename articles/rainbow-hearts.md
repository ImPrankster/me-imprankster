### Check out my work [here](https://editor.p5js.org/ImPrankster/full/ctwhPZYf-)

This is kinda like the idea I described in the _On Conditional Design._ Its basically just a constantly growing stripe of rainbow-colored hearts. And looking at stripe constantly growing is very pleasing.

Under here is my code, I used lambda expression to create new functions to make it as neat as possible. [View the screenshot here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P2hOm_zLeNMxlhqJycMSuXfQGspJDrW_/view?usp=sharing)

```jsx
let currentX = 100;
let currentY = 100;
let currentHue = 0;
let hueAdding = true;
let directions = ["up", "down", "left", "right"];

let heartShape = (x, y, size) => {
  //From the p5.js example
  beginShape();
  vertex(x, y);
  bezierVertex(x - size / 2, y - size / 2, x - size, y + size / 3, x, y + size);
  bezierVertex(x + size, y + size / 3, x + size / 2, y - size / 2, x, y);
  endShape(CLOSE);
};

let setNewLocation = () => {
  if (currentX <= 50 || currentX >= 350 || currentY <= 50 || currentY >= 350) {
    if (currentX <= 50) {
      currentX += 10;
    }
    if (currentX >= 350) {
      currentX -= 10;
    }
    if (currentY <= 50) {
      currentY += 10;
    }
    if (currentY >= 350) {
      currentY -= 10;
    }
    return;
  }
  //If the shape is almost outside the canvas, move it inside.

  switch (random(directions)) {
    case "up":
      currentX += 10;
      break;
    case "down":
      currentX -= 10;
      break;
    case "left":
      currentY -= 10;
      break;
    case "right":
      currentY += 10;
      break;
  }
};

let addNewShape = () => {
  setNewLocation();
  let x = currentX;
  let y = currentY;
  if (hueAdding == true) {
    currentHue += 5;
  } else {
    currentHue -= 5;
  }
  let h = currentHue;
  strokeWeight(4);
  stroke(10);
  fill(h, 91, 96);
  heartShape(x, y, 25);
};

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  colorMode(HSB);
}

function draw() {
  addNewShape();
  if (currentHue >= 360) {
    hueAdding = false;
  }
  if (currentHue <= 0) {
    hueAdding = true;
  }
}
```

The biggest thing I learned in this project is the use of HSV color mode, itâ€™s so much easier to use than RGB color mode when you just want to change the hue of the color!
